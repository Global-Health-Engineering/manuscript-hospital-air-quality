  abstract = {The World Health Organization estimates that particulate matter (PM) air pollution contributes to approximately 800,000 premature deaths each year, ranking it the 13th leading cause of mortality worldwide. However, many studies show that the relationship is deeper and far more complicated than originally thought. PM is a portion of air pollution that is made up of extremely small particles and liquid droplets containing acids, organic chemicals, metals, and soil or dust particles. PM is categorized by size and continues to be the fraction of air pollution that is most reliably associated with human disease. PM is thought to contribute to cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease by the mechanisms of systemic inflammation, direct and indirect coagulation activation, and direct translocation into systemic circulation. The data demonstrating PM's effect on the cardiovascular system are strong. Populations subjected to long-term exposure to PM have a significantly higher cardiovascular incident and mortality rate. Short-term acute exposures subtly increase the rate of cardiovascular events within days of a pollution spike. The data are not as strong for PM's effects on cerebrovascular disease, though some data and similar mechanisms suggest a lesser result with smaller amplitude. Respiratory diseases are also exacerbated by exposure to PM. PM causes respiratory morbidity and mortality by creating oxidative stress and inflammation that leads to pulmonary anatomic and physiologic remodeling. The literature shows PM causes worsening respiratory symptoms, more frequent medication use, decreased lung function, recurrent health care utilization, and increased mortality. PM exposure has been shown to have a small but significant adverse effect on cardiovascular, respiratory, and to a lesser extent, cerebrovascular disease. These consistent results are shown by multiple studies with varying populations, protocols, and regions. The data demonstrate a dose-dependent relationship between PM and human disease, and that removal from a PM-rich environment decreases the prevalence of these diseases. While further study is needed to elucidate the effects of composition, chemistry, and the PM effect on susceptible populations, the preponderance of data shows that PM exposure causes a small but significant increase in human morbidity and mortality. Most sources agree on certain ``common sense'' recommendations, although there are lonely limited data to support them. Indoor PM exposure can be reduced by the usage of air conditioning and particulate filters, decreasing indoor combustion for heating and cooking, and smoking cessation. Susceptible populations, such as the elderly or asthmatics, may benefit from limiting their outdoor activity during peak traffic periods or poor air quality days. These simple changes may benefit individual patients in both short-term symptomatic control and long-term cardiovascular and respiratory complications.}

  abstract = {While numerous studies have demonstrated that shortterm exposure to particulate matter (PM*) is associated with adverse health effects, the characteristics of PM that cause harm are not well understood, and PM toxicity may vary by its chemical composition. This study investigates whether spatial and temporal patterns in PM health effect estimates based on total mass can be explained by spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the chemical composition of the particles. A database of 52 chemical components of PM with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; or = 2.5 pm (PM2.5) was constructed for 187 U.S. counties, for 2000 through 2005, based on data from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) monitoring networks. Components that covary with PM2.5 total mass and/or are large contributors to PM2.5, total mass were identified using actual and seasonally detrended data. Using Bayesian hierarchical modeling, seasonal and temporal variation in PM2.5 and the risk of total, cardiovascular, and respiratory hospital admissions were investigated for persons \&gt; or = 65 years in 202 U.S. counties for 1999 through 2005. Seasonal variation was investigated using three model structures with different underlying assumptions about the relationship between PM2.5 and hospitalizations. The findings of this study indicate higher effects in winter for both causes of hospitalization, and higher effects in the Northeast for cardiovascular admissions, although 53\% of the counties were in this region. Higher PM2.5 effect estimates for cardiovascular or respiratory hospitalizations were observed in seasons and counties with a higher PM2.5 content of nickel (Ni), vanadium (V), or EC. Mortality effect estimates for PM with an aerodynamic diameter \&lt; or = 10 pm (PM10) were higher in seasons and counties with higher PM2.5 Ni content. The association between the Ni content of PM2.5 and effect estimates for cardiovascular hospitalization was robust to adjustment by EC, V, or both EC and V. An interquartile range (IQR) increase in the fraction of PM2.5 that is Ni was associated with a 14.9\% (PI, 3.4-26.4) increase in the relative rates of cardiovascular hospital admissions associated with PM2.5 total mass adjusted for EC and V. No associations were observed between PM total mass health effect estimates and community-level variables for socioeconomic status, racial composition, or urbanicity. Communities with a higher prevalence of central AC had lower PM2.5 effect estimates for cardiovascular hospital admissions. The findings of this study indicate strong spatial and temporal variation in the chemical composition of the particle mixture and in the regional and seasonal variation in health effect estimates for PM2.5 total mass. The chemical composition of particles partially explained the heterogeneity of effect estimates. Observed associations could be related to the components themselves, to other components, or to a combination of components that share similar sources. The findings do not exclude the possibility that other components or characteristics of PM are harmful. The limitations of this study include the use of community-level aggregated data for exposure and for the variables used to investigate alternate hypotheses. Also, particle components and chemical forms (e.g., ammonium sulfate) not measured in the U.S. EPA database were not included. PM10 results in particular should be viewed with caution as the time frame of measurement and PM size fraction are different for the chemical composition and health effects data. A better understanding of the particular chemical components or sources that are most harmful to health can help decision-makers develop more targeted air pollution regulations and can aid in understanding the biological mechanisms by which air pollution-related health effects occur, thereby informing future research.},

  abstract = {Air quality in urban areas is a cause of concern because of increased industrial activities that contribute~to large quantities of emissions. The study assess levels and variations of carbon monoxide (CO),~nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) in Blantyre, Malawi using a stationary environmental~monitoring station (EMS). Results show that CO level (2.47 {$\pm$} 1.23 mg m-3) were below the Malawian limit~value (10.31 mg m-3). Although, NO2 (4.02 {$\pm$} 2.47 mg m-3) and SO2 (8.58 {$\pm$} 2.88 mg m-3) were significantly~higher than allowable Malawian Standards (0.52 and 0.23 mg m-3, respectively). Discernible variations in~hourly, diurnal, monthly and seasonal CO, SO2 and NO2 were apparent. Independent t-test confirmed~that day time values were higher than those at night (p {$<$} 0.05). Thus, variations in local weather affect~the disparity in hourly and diurnal values. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) confirmed significant variations~in monthly observations. Moreover, independent t-test showed that wet season CO (2.32 mg m-3), SO2~(5.10 mg m-3) and NO2 (9.41 mg m-3) levels were higher than dry season values (CO = 2.32 mg m-3; SO2 =~3.42 mg m-3; NO2 = 8.13 mg m-3). A hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) divided the 10 months into three~groups based on distribution of CO, SO2 and NO2, air temperature, wind speed and wind direction.~Furthermore, factor analysis (FA) showed that air temperature had significant contribution to variations~in mean values of CO, SO2 and NO2 for the entire study period. The study shows a need for constant~urban air quality monitoring in Blantyre and all urban areas in Malawi. It is recommended that the~experimental site widen the scope of the study by utilizing the flexibility of the EMS.~Key words: Air pollutants, principal component analysis, developing countries, environmental monitoringstation, Kaiser normalization.},
